## Features

* **Dynamic Product Catalog:** All cakes, cupcakes, and cookies are loaded directly from a MySQL database.
* **Category Filtering:** The catalog page can be filtered to show items by category (e.g., `catalog.php?category=cupcake`).
* **Product Detail Pages:** Clicking any product image loads a separate, dynamic page (`product.php`) with that item's details.
* **Contact Form:** A working "Application" form that safely saves user submissions to the `applications` table in the database.
